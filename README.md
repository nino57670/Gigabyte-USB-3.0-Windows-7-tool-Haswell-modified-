Gigabyte USB 3.0 Windows 7 Tool "Haswell+" (Modified)
Overview

This is a modified version of the official Gigabyte USB 3.0 Windows 7 Tool.
The original utility was designed to inject USB 3.0 drivers into Windows 7 installation media, but it was limited in compatibility.

The "Haswell+" modification extends support to both Intel Haswell and newer chipsets as well as modern AMD platforms, and allows the tool to run properly on modern versions of Windows (Windows 10/11).

This makes it possible to:

Create Windows 7 installation media with native USB 3.0 drivers.

Install and use Windows 7 on modern Intel and AMD hardware that no longer natively supports it.

Features

Injects USB 3.0 drivers directly into Windows 7 installation files.

Compatible with Intel Haswell and newer chipsets.

Compatible with modern AMD platforms.

Modified to run on recent versions of Windows (unlike the original release).

Simplifies the process of creating bootable Windows 7 USB installers.

Requirements

A Windows 10/11 PC to run the tool.

Original Windows 7 ISO or installation media.

USB flash drive (at least 8GB recommended).

How It Works

Launch the tool on a modern Windows system.

Select your Windows 7 ISO or installation media.

The tool will inject USB 3.0 drivers into the boot.wim and install.wim files.

Create a bootable USB stick with the patched files.

Use the new USB installer to install Windows 7 on Intel Haswell+ or AMD platforms.

Notes

This project is a community modification, not an official Gigabyte release.

The tool is provided as-is and should be used at your own risk.

Ideal for enthusiasts who need Windows 7 on modern Intel and AMD hardware.
