        systray Application.

4927315 Uninstalling Thunderbolt Software immediately after PC restarts is prevented by the
        "Thunderbolt(TM) Conditional Application starter" 

4927434 Service crash after entering Sx while device is being authorized.


Version 16.2.55.275
4927384a QoS warning appears on Alpine Ridge device when DP consumes all the link bandwidth.

4927384b QoS warning incorrectly reported when connecting two 4K monitors.

4927271 GUI tree is reported as empty after cold boot to OS while devices are connected.


Version 16.2.52.250
4926352 When security level is "Secure Connect", after disconnecting and reconnecting devices while
        the PC is in sleep mode, the authorization window will not automatically open but the devices
        still need to be re-authorized.

4926536 Application GUI does not pop up on device hot-plug after initial package installation.

4926798 Thunderbolt.exe is managed code and will have impact on boot time even if the Systray 
        Application should not be running (e.g. no Thunderbolt device is connected).

4927148 Once a Thunderbolt networking session is established, restarting one peer may leave the 
        Connection Status of the remote peer to be reported incorrectly as well as the Thunderbolt 
        Networking menu being greyed out, even if the networking functionality is still working.

4927198 Once a Thunderbolt networking session is established, the GUI tree may be not showing the 
        remote peer after this one is restarted.

4927150 In some timing race conditions the Systray Application icon does not appear, and should 
        be launched manually.

4927167 Unable to access remote peer using the "Desktop Icon"/"My computer icon" when the name
        of the remote PC was changed.

4927180 Unable to access remote peer using the "Desktop Icon"/"My computer icon" when the Thunderbolt
        Service was restarted.

4927195 A device white listed in Security Level 1 (i.e. "User Authorization") will not be authorized
        when moving to Security Level 2 (i.e. "Secure Connect") until it is removed from the white list
        and reinserted.

4927199 When no Thunderbolt Controller is present, running manually the Thunderbolt Software may 
        report incorrectly a need for Firmware Update.

4927217 No authorization window appear for device approval after Sx resume when "Wake on Thunderbolt"
        is disabled in BIOS.

4927179 In some languages (ENU, JPN, PTB) the eGPU toast notification is truncated.

4927227 After performing INF upgrade, the Thunderbolt SW is indeed not installed.

4926842 Upon Thunderbolt networking connection, it is possible to delete the peer icon located on the
        desktop, however it will be restored on desktop refresh (pressing F5)


Known Issues
============
4926127 In this version the SW stack goes down when the last device is disconnected. However, 
        the system tray application will stay up if the last device is disconnected within a few
        seconds of the user changing the settings. 

4926928 Concurrent install/upgrade can lead the Thunderbolt Software to be partially installed if it is 
        run unattended while another MSI process is already running. In such a case the Thunderbolt
        software should be removed and re-installed.

4927310 Connecting a Thunderbolt device in the middle of the Thunderbolt Software installation process
        may lead the software to miss the automatic launch when installation is done. 
        Disconnecting the device for at least 10sec and reconnecting it will trigger the software again.
        
Limitations
============
   -  The Thunderbolt Networking implementation does not support Link aggregation (a.k.a. NIC teaming) 
      via the OS.
